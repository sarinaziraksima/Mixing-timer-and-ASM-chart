# Mixing-timer-and-ASM-chart

In this project, we displayed a pattern on four output pins and used three buttons to change how it is displayed. The functions of the buttons are as follows: 1. Pausing the pattern, 2. Resetting the pattern, and 3. Selecting the duration of each pattern for 1 or 2 seconds. To show the pattern, we used a code formed according to the ASM chart pattern of 0000-0001-1001-1000-0111-1111, which changes its state when the selected timer is triggered.
